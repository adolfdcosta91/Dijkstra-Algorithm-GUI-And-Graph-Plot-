# Dijkstra Algorithm (GUI and Graph)
The goal of this project is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm using python and find the shortest path for the given input. The system accepts the user input using a dynamic GUI, which makes it convenient for all users. It then computes the results and plots a graph of all nodes and edges along with their weight so that the user can visualize the results seamlessly. It prints all possible paths along with the shortest one.
