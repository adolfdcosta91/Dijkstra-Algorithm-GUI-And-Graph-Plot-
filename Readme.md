# Dijkstra Algorithm (GUI and Graph)
The goal of this project was to impliment Dijkstra's algorithm using python, and find the shortest path for the given input. The system accept the user input using GUI, which makes it convinient for all users, then computes the reults and plots a graph and prints the result.
